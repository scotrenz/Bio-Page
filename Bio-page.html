	<!--About Me Bio-->
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h3>Howdy!</h3>
	<p>I have always loved tech and have dabbled in programming for the last 2 years. I finally made the jump and enrolled in a bootcamp to help accelerate my learning. I have since developed most of my projects using JavaScript, CSS, Angular.js, and MongoDB. </p>
	<p>My background has been diverse over the years. Born in rural Iowa originally going for my bachelors in Aerospace I wanted more excitement than Iowa could provide. Two years into my collegiate career I moved to New York in pursuit of acting and modeling. Three years of doing off-Broadway shows and catalog work I found my next passion in fitness. To satisfy my entreprnurial tendencies I open my own company training clients, other trainers, and writing research reviews to help bridge the gap between new research and practical public understanding. I love my company and the work I do with it but I would be remiss not to notice the large affects tech has on society and the immeasurable possiblitiies it has to shape our future.</p>
	<p>Such a background has given my has given me a diverse skillset and wide breadth of industry experience. If there's anything you want to know about what goes on in actor changing rooms or the optimal environment for muscle protein synthesis let me know!</p>
	<p>When I'm not coding I can often be found in the gym, building a motorcycle in my living room, or nerding out about human behavior, economics, business, and tech.</p>
